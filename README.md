# Auto_Solid_View
In Blender, when starting a render, if the blender viewport is already in rendered mode, the rendering is a bit slower, because the gpu is still rendering in the viewport too. By using this script you can make blender automatically change to solid view when starting a full render.

# Usage:
You can either open the 3DView_to_Solid.py inside your Blender text editor and run it from there, or if you want it to execute automatically on Blender start-up, you can put in in your C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Roaming\Blender Foundation\Blender\[blender version]\scripts\startup folder.
